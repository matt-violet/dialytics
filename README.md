# Dialytics

Welcome to Dialytics, an app using React and the Dexcom API. Dialytics is a helpful reporting tool for those managing their blood sugar with Dexcom's Continuous Glucose Monitoring. It provides real glucose data - obtained from the Dexcom API via the OAuth 2 framework - displayed in easy to read charts, statistics, trends, and device settings.
